     At a lemonade stand, each lemonade costs $5.
 
     Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you, and order one at a time (in the order specified by bills).
 
     Each customer will only buy one lemonade and pay with either a $5, $10, or $20 bill.  You must provide the correct change to each customer, so that the net transaction is that the customer pays $5.
 
     Note that you don't have any change in hand at first.
 
     Return true if and only if you can provide every customer with correct change.
