     We have an array A of integers, and an array queries of queries.
 
     For the i-th query val = queries[i][0], index = queries[i][1], we add val to A[index].  Then, the answer to the i-th query is the sum of the even values of A.
 
     (Here, the given index = queries[i][1] is a 0-based index, and each query permanently modifies the array A.)
 
     Return the answer to all queries.  Your answer array should have answer[i] as the answer to the i-th query.
 
 
 
     Example 1:
 
     Input: A = [1,2,3,4], queries = [[1,0],[-3,1],[-4,0],[2,3]]
     Output: [8,6,2,4]
     Explanation:
     At the beginning, the array is [1,2,3,4].
     After adding 1 to A[0], the array is [2,2,3,4], and the sum of even values is 2 + 2 + 4 = 8.
     After adding -3 to A[1], the array is [2,-1,3,4], and the sum of even values is 2 + 4 = 6.
     After adding -4 to A[0], the array is [-2,-1,3,4], and the sum of even values is -2 + 4 = 2.
     After adding 2 to A[3], the array is [-2,-1,3,6], and the sum of even values is -2 + 6 = 4.
 
 
     Note:
 
     1 <= A.length <= 10000
     -10000 <= A[i] <= 10000
     1 <= queries.length <= 10000
     -10000 <= queries[i][0] <= 10000
     0 <= queries[i][1] < A.length

        // Get initial sum of the even numbers
        var sum = A.lazy.filter({ $0 % 2 == 0 }).reduce(0, +)

        for i in 0..<queries.count {
            let value = queries[i][0], index = queries[i][1]

                sum += modA[index]
