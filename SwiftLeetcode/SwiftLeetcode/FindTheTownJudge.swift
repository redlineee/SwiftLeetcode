     https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-town-judge/
 
     In a town, there are N people labelled from 1 to N.  There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.
 
     If the town judge exists, then:
 
     The town judge trusts nobody.
     Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
     There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.
     You are given trust, an array of pairs trust[i] = [a, b] representing that the person labelled a trusts the person labelled b.
 
     If the town judge exists and can be identified, return the label of the town judge.  Otherwise, return -1.
 
 
 
     Example 1:
 
     Input: N = 2, trust = [[1,2]]
     Output: 2
     Example 2:
 
     Input: N = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3]]
     Output: 3
     Example 3:
 
     Input: N = 3, trust = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,1]]
     Output: -1
     Example 4:
 
     Input: N = 3, trust = [[1,2],[2,3]]
     Output: -1
     Example 5:
 
     Input: N = 4, trust = [[1,3],[1,4],[2,3],[2,4],[4,3]]
     Output: 3
 
 
     Note:
 
     1 <= N <= 1000
     trust.length <= 10000
     trust[i] are all different
     trust[i][0] != trust[i][1]
     1 <= trust[i][0], trust[i][1] <= N
